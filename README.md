ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

This is my personal developer portfolio website â€” a place where Iâ€™ve put together everything about what I do, the projects Iâ€™ve built, and how to reach out to me.

Itâ€™s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on smooth animations and a responsive layout that works across devices.

Whatâ€™s Inside

A clean homepage with my intro

Project section with links to what Iâ€™ve built

Contact section (yep, you can actually email me)

Smooth transitions and scroll-based effects

Fully responsive â€” looks good on both mobile and desktop

Tech Used

HTML5

CSS3 (with animation and transitions)

Vanilla JavaScript

No heavy frameworks â€” just clean code.
